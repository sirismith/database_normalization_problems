Database Normalization Problems
=========
Database normalization is a necessary evil. It is sometimes more necessary, sometimes less necessary, but unless there is a good reason not to normalize a database, then it is necessary nonetheless. Though "evil" may be a strong word, database normalization can be a headache, at the very least. Normalization design is one of the most difficult things about it, as it may require the slow process of joining tables, and good normalization design must 

    1. use storage space efficiently
    2. eliminate duplicate data
    3. eliminate inconsistent data
    4. make the database low-maintenance.

SQL is the fundamental language for relational databases, which is often a headache, as well. SQL tends to be slow, hard for humans and computers to analyze, inconsistent, and contain little modularization. SQL is also a declarative language, or, it tells a computer what to do, and most computer programmers are used to languages that tell the computer how to do something.
